# 4. ATAM

1. The level of confidentiality in a virtual private network might be *sensitive* to the number of bits of encryption. -> [[Lecture Notes/Software Architecture/sa#4.1 Sensitivity Points|sa]] also [[Lecture Notes/Software Architecture/sa#4.2 Risks|sa]]
2. Changing the level of encryption could have a significant impact on both security and performance. -> [[Lecture Notes/Software Architecture/sa#4.4 Tradeoffs|sa]]
3. Assuming message arrival rates of once per second, a processing time of less than 30 ms, and the existence of one higher priority process, a 1 second soft deadline seems reasonable. -> [[Lecture Notes/Software Architecture/sa#4.3 Non-risks|sa]]
