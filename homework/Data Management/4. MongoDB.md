# 5. 实验过程

## 5.1 MongoDB的安装

本次我选择在Ubuntu20.04上安装MongoDB，因为MongoDB目前还不支持22.04参考的是官方的安装文档：

[Install MongoDB Community Edition on Ubuntu — MongoDB Manual](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v6.0/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/)

首先，我们需要确保已经安装了gnupg：

```shell
sudo apt install gnupg
```

之后我们要导入一个mongodb的软件秘钥到apt中：

```shell
wget -qO - https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-6.0.asc | sudo apt-key add -
```

> 之前我是在Ubuntu22.04上做的，上面说这种做法已经过时了。新的使用方法可以通过`man apt-key 8`来查看。

然后需要创建一个list file在`/etc/apt/source.list.d`文件夹下。这个文件夹其实就是对souce.list的补充，可以以单独的文件来分开管理软件源，而不用直接编辑source.list。

```shell
echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu focal/mongodb-org/6.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-6.0.list
```

> `tee`是Linux命令，用于显示程序的输出并将其复制到一个文件中。

添加了新的软件源，自然要刷新一下了：

```shell
sudo apt update
```

之后就可以安装软件包了，官方的软件包叫做`mongodb-org`。

```shell
sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org
```

> -y表示自动yes，不询问是否安装。

> The `mongodb` package provided by Ubuntu is **not** maintained by MongoDB Inc. and conflicts with the official `mongodb-org` package. If you have already installed the `mongodb` package on your Ubuntu system, you **must** first uninstall the `mongodb` package before proceeding with these instructions.

## 5.2 MongoDB的启动

使用下面的命令启动MongoDB服务：

```shell
sudo systemctl start mongod
```

但是我遇到了问题，参考下面的文章解决了。但是具体的原因我还是看不明白是为什么。

[bdd - MongoDB.service failed with result exit-code - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60309575/mongodb-service-failed-with-result-exit-code)

[MongoDB loads but breaks, returning status=14 - Ask Ubuntu](https://askubuntu.com/questions/823288/mongodb-loads-but-breaks-returning-status-14)

```shell
sudo chown -R mongodb:mongodb /var/lib/mongodb
sudo chown mongodb:mongodb /tmp/mongodb-27017.sock
sudo service mongod restart
```

## 5.3 MongoDB的使用

然后就可以进入mongodb专用的shell了：

```shell
mongosh
```

具体的使用方法也可以参考官方文档：

[Run Commands — MongoDB Shell](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/run-commands/)

首先，我们可以直接使用`use`命令来创建一个数据库：

```sql
use news
```

然后，甚至可以直接创建Collection并插入数据：

```sql
db.mynews.insertOne({
	title: 'haha'
	author: 'Spread'
	time: '2022-11-2'
	source: 'Xidian'
	cotent: 'hehe'
})
```

插入的方式就是一个个json。而如果想插入一个json数组，可以这样：

```sql
db.mynews.insertMany(
	[
		{},
		{},
		{}
	]
)
```

**json对象可以嵌套数组，数组也可以由多个json对象组成。**

---

接下来，是查询操作，这里和普通SQL语句去对比会非常好解释。如果我们想找到当前Collection里的所有json，就可以这样(**下面是等价的SQL语句**)：

```sql
db.mynews.find()
select * from mynews;
```

如果要再加上对于某个条件的选择操作(比如某个key是某个value的所有json对象)，就可以这样：

```sql
db.mynews.find({author: 'Spread'})
select * from mynews where author = 'Spread';
```

---

然后是更新操作，这里也分为更新一个和更新多个的操作。如果我们要把作者是`Chris Willman`的json的作者改成`Spread`，就可以这样：

```sql
db.mynews.updateOne({author: 'Chris Willman'},
	{
		$set:{
			author: 'Spread'
		}
	}
)
```

如果要更新多个，注意：第一个参数还是判断条件。如果我们要更新所有存款小于100的：

```sql
use sample_airbnb

db.listingsAndReviews.updateMany(
  { security_deposit: { $lt: 100 } },
  {
    $set: { security_deposit: 100, minimum_nights: 1 }
  }
)
```

> 这里的`$lt`是标志位，表示小于。

---

delete操作和update操作非常像，也是给一个判断条件，然后删除对应的json；同样也支持删除一个或者多个。

---

简单的排序可以通过`sort`函数来实现：

```sql
db.mynews.find().sort({time: 1})
# 按照time排序，1表示升序；-1表示降序。
```

---

MongoDB的方法非常多，具体可以到下面的地址查看：

[mongosh Methods — MongoDB Manual](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/)

# 6. 实验成果

下面是我对新闻数据库的一些操作，新闻是在Google News上找的。
