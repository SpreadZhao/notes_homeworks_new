# Depth First Search

#rating/medium #question/coding/theory/algorithm #date 2023-03-22

Core idea of Depth First Search: **If one node has connected neighbors <u>but not visited</u>, just jump into it recursively!** Once there's no any connected one, do the back trace and return, until we find the next node fitting the requirement above or reach the end of the search.

Now given the implementaiton of the Graph structure **in matrix** in java:

```java
public class MatrixGraph {  
    private final static int NOT_EXIST = Integer.MAX_VALUE;  
    private final static int NOT_FOUND = Integer.MIN_VALUE;  
    public int[][] edges;  
    public GraphType type;  
  
    public int size;  
    public boolean[] visited;
	... ...
}
```

> **We assume that the index of edges is the index of nodes.**

With the prequisite that **index is the number of nodes**, we can ensure the edge internal of the case above:

```java
int[][] edges = {
//       v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 v6
        {1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1},  // v1
        {1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0},  // v2
        {0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0},  // v3
        {0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0},  // v4
        {0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0},  // v5
        {1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1}   // v6
};
```

Either DFS of BFS is just a **iteration** in this matrix. At first, we should make every node UNVISITED:

```java
for(int i = 0; i < G.size; i++) G.visited[i] = false;
```

Then we take the start node from our input, and call the internal recursive function:

```java
public static void DFS(MatrixGraph G, int start){  
        for(int i = 0; i < G.size; i++) G.visited[i] = false;  
        DFS_Core(G, start);  
}
```

In the recursion, we first mark the current node as VISITED, and **found any connected neighbor who is UNVISITED**, then call myelf recursively:

```java
private static void DFS_Core(MatrixGraph G, int index){  
    System.out.println("[" + index +  "]");  
    G.visited[index] = true;  
    for(int i = firstNeighbor(G, index); 
	    i != NOT_FOUND; 
	    i = secondNeighbor(G, index, i)){  
	        DFS_Core(G, i);  
    }  
}
```

There're two specific functions above: `firstNeighbor()` and `secondNeighbor`. I start from my first neighbor and after having done it's recursion work, I turn to the second neighbor. In the case above, we start from v1's first neighbor v2, and v2 also start from it's first neighbor v3 ... After v5's recursion work, the **`secondNeighbor()` can't find any connected and UNVISITED neighbor, so it return NOT_FOUND to i**. Then v5's recursion terminated and return to v4's. But this time the function also cannot find any eligible neighbor. After the NOT_FOUND repeatedly generated and recursion continuously hop back to v1, `secondNeighbor()` finally found another neighbor v6 fitted. So the next recursion is called.

The function implementation is easy to understand, I paste them below:

```java
// Find the first connected and UNVISITED neighbor node of index.  
private static int firstNeighbor(MatrixGraph G, int index){  
    for(int j = 0; j < G.size; j++){  
        if(G.edgeExist(index, j) && !G.visited[j]) return j;  
    }  
    return NOT_FOUND;  
} 
/**  
 * Find the second connected and UNVISITED neighbor node of index, 
 * except f_index 
 * @param G Graph to search  
 * @param index the target node  
 * @param f_index the first neighbor of the target node  
 * @return the index of the second neighbor  
 */
private static int secondNeighbor(MatrixGraph G, int index, int f_index){  
	for(int j = f_index + 1; j < G.size; j++){  
		if(G.edgeExist(index, j) && !G.visited[j]) return j;  
	}  
	return NOT_FOUND;  
}
```

Also, there's a more effortless solution of the core of DFS, you can see it on my leetcode blogs.
