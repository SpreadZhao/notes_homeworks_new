When I searched **Kotlin Polymorphism**, I found that when we pass the parent class, we can use `is` operator to transfer the type of the param safely:

However, we can aslo make the type of a param in the declaration **interface** to make the real param search its own implementation automatically. Such mechanism is called **Interface Oriented Programming**, aslo Polymorphism.
