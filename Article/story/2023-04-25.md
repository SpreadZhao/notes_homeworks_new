# NIO Check in

#NIO

The logic of NIO's **Car Search Service** relies on a series of underlying services for implementation. For the search service may always be killed by os, we need a **permanent** process to handle the **status and the transition of them** for each component in our program.

So far we have known four occasions where the **Car Search Service** will be invoked:

* Account behavior(log in, log out);
* Connecting with car(SOA);
* UWB signal(when get out of or in car);
* Launching the Car Control Card App(Side key of the phone).

In these four cases, we should manually invoke our initial app to register our services to offer supplement for the next operations such as parking space recognition.

All the registry behaviors were defined in a singleton Java class called **InitManager**, we manage all the relative functions here. The entry func is called `init()`, which is triggered by Java Reflect temporarily in the occasions above:

```java
public void init() {
	if(isInit.getAndSet(true)) {
		return;
	}
	...
	SearchSignalService.getInstance().init();
	PositionInitTask.getInstance().init(null);
	MapEngineInitTask.getInstance().init();
	LocationProxy.getInstance().init();
	fetchTask.loop();
}
```

Now we make a simple mock on the trigger stack internal. The Main Application launched by the side key of the phone is not a traditional app with a main activity, but a built-in-system app with a series of permanent processes. So we need to **customize** our own Application to provide services. Look at our AndroidManifest.xml **in main App**:

```xml
<application
	android:name="com.skyui.vehicle.SkyVehicleApplication"
	...>
	
	<activity
		android:name="xxx.VehicleControlTransActivity"
		...
	>	
	</activity>

	<activity
		android:name="xxx.MockAccountActivity"
		...
	>	
	</activity>

	
</application>
```

The customized Application is called SkyVehicleAppication, which is extended from BaseApplication of us:

```kotlin
class SkyVehicleApplication : BaseApplication()
```

> All our stories after clicking the side key of the phone starts from here.

In BaseApplication, we check **if the current process is the process we want**, and do the corresponding opreations. But why we have to do that? This logic is implemented in the `onCreate()` of an Application. So once the application start, the codes will be run by one time. Of course our **Car Search Service** is included in that. Once the SkyVehicleApplication start, all of the **sub components** of that process will be initialized properly.

So, what is the **process we want**? The answer is:

```kotlin
open class BaseApplication: Application() {
	override fun onCreate() {
		super.onCreate()
		...
		if (getProcessName == "com.skyui.vehicle:VMS") {
			// do Init
		}
	}
}
```

NIO underlying launch logic(AOSP) has described that,  #question/coding/theory ~~(all of 4?)~~ **once we receive an SOA broadcast from the car, the `onCreate()` function of an Application class will be run**, so we can do our registration(init) here. However, you may confuse that we do not have a process called `"com.skyui.vehicle:VMS"` in AndroidManifest.xml above, how can we get in the `onCreate()` function? The SkyVehicleApplication was extended from Application, but in another AndroidManifest.xml of **Car Search Service**, we use an anonymous one:

```xml
<application>
	<receiver
		android:process="VMS"
	>
	<provider
		android:process="VMS"
	>
	...
</application>
```

> This application is exactly what we concerned instead of the one above.

During the compiling process of the main app, all of the AndroidManifest.xml will be integrated into one unit. **An application without name will be merged into one with name**, so these two separated xmls are actually of the same name. This technique make us enabled to check different process tags in the `onCreate()` logic, such as:

```kotlin
if (getProcessName == "com.skyui.vehicle:VMS") {
	// do Init
}
```

What is `do Init`? Obviously the registration of services such as:

* Checking and using SOA Connection(s);
* Getting information from car device(s);
* Initialize the car(s) state.

#question/coding/theory ~~Is that true?~~

Beyond these features, there're also some **listeners** to check out the change of status. Actually, those functions are just contained in the core function `init()` [[#^9eabae|above]]. However, just as what we have talked about, the trigger is currently mocked with Java Reflection. So we should do reflection here in `do Init` and call `init()`:

```java
if (getProcessName == "com.skyui.vehicle:VMS") {
	try {
		val clazz = Class.forName("com.skyui.vehicleservice.search.init.InitManager")
		val instance = clazz.getMethod("newInstance").invoke(clazz)
		clazz.getMethod("init").invoke(instance)
	} catch (e: Exception) {
		e.printStackTrace()
	}
}
```
